# To-Do list

* Add "glance" function. Keybinds already in place. Some functionality needs to be moved from old status outputs into appropriate places, like mag ammo check.
* Add room descriptions. Need to figure out data structure for this.
* Clean up help function to not destroy existing text output.

## Planned features

* **Enemies**
* **Aiming**
* **Advanced Movement** (move, move fast, dodge)
* **Combined Actions** (move + shoot, dodge + reload, etc)
* **Time System** (each action takes x.xx[random] seconds)
